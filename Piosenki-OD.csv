I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones

Seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone



And I'll be gone, gone tonight

The ground beneath my feet is open wide

The way that I been holding on too tight

With nothing in between



The story of my life

I take her home

I drive all night

To keep her warm

And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life

I give her hope

I spend her love

Until she's broke

Inside

The story of my life (the story of, the story of)



Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change

Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage

I know that in the morning now I see us in the light upon a hill

Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still



And I'll be gone, gone tonight

The fire beneath my feet is burning bright

The way that I been holding on so tight

With nothing in between



The story of my life

I take her home

I drive all night

To keep her warm

And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life

I give her hope

I spend her love

Until she's broke

Inside

The story of my life (the story of, the story of)



And I been waiting for this time to come around

But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds



The story of my life

I take her home

I drive all night

To keep her warm

And time is frozen

The story of my life

I give her hope (give her hope)

I spend her love

Until she's broke (until she's broke inside)

Inside

The story of my life (the story of, the story of)



The story of my life

The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life"

Don't know what for

To cover up



Being the way that you are is en-o-ough

Everyone else but you

So c-come on



You got it wrong



To prove I'm right I put it in a so-o-ong



I don't know why



You're being shy



And turn away when I look into your ey-e-es.

Or ask if I'm okay

I don't have the answer

Don't make me stay the night

Or ask if I'm alright

I don't have the answer



Heartache doesn't last forever

I'll say I'm fine

Midnight ain't no time for laughing

When you say goodbye



It makes your lips so kissable

And your kiss unmissable

Your fingertips so touchable

And your eyes irresistible

I've tried to ask myself



Should I see someone else?

I wish I knew the answer

But I know, if I go now, if I leave

Then I'm on my own tonight

I'll never know the answer

Midnight doesn't last forever

Dark turns to light

Heartache flips my world around



I'm falling down, down, down

That's why

I find your lips so kissable

And your kiss unmissable

Your fingertips so touchable



And your eyes irresistible

Irresistible

Irresistible

Irresistible

Irresistible



It's in your lips and in your kiss

It's in your touch and your fingertips

And it's in all the things and other things

That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible

It makes your lips so kissable

And your kiss invincible

Your fingertips so touchable

I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out

I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt

I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding

There are many things that I would like to say to you

But I don't know how

Because maybe

You're gonna be the one that saves me

And after all

You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you

By now you shoulda somehow realized what you're not to do

I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

I said maybe

You're gonna be the one that saves me

You're my wonderwall"

That I can't explain

I leave my heart open

But it stays right here empty for days



She told me in the morning

She don't feel the same about us in her bones

It seems to me that when I die

These words will be written on my stone



And I'll be gone gone tonight

The ground beneath my feet is open wide

The way that I've been holdin' on too tight

With nothing in between



The story of my life I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm and time

Is frozen (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life I give her hope

I spend her love

Until she's broke inside

The story of my life (the story of, the story of)



Written on these walls

Are the colors that I can't change

Leave my heart open

But it stays right here in its cage



I know that in the morning now

I see us in the light upon a hill

Althought I am broken

My heart is untamed, still



And I'll be gone gone tonight

The fire beneath my feet is burning bright

The way that I've been holdin' on so tight

With nothing in between



The story of my life I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm and time

Is frozen (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life I give her hope

I spend her love

Until she's broke inside

The story of my life (the story of, the story of)



And I've been waiting for this time to come around

But baby running after you

Is like chasing the clouds



The story of my life I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm and time

Is frozen

The story of my life

I give her hope (give her hope)

I spend her love

Until she's broke inside (until she's broke inside)

The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life

Take a bullet straight through my brain



Yes I would die for ya baby, but you wont do the same.



Black, black, black and blue beat me till Im am numb

Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where

Like it's made just for me

But bear this in mind

It was meant to be

And it all makes sense to me

I know you've never loved

The crinkles by your eyes

When you smile

You've never loved

Your stomach or your thighs

The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine

But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

But if I do

It's you

Oh, it's you they add up to

I'm in love with you

And all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea

And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep

And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep

Though it makes no sense to me

I know you've never loved

The sound of your voice on tape

You never want

To know how much you weigh

You still have to squeeze into your jeans

But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

But if it's true

It's you

It's you they add up to

I'm in love with you

And all these little things

You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you

And you'll never treat yourself right, darling, but I want you to.

If I let you know I'm here for you

Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh.

And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth

Close the door

Throw the key

Don't wanna be reminded

Don't wanna be seen

Don't wanna be without you

Like tonight's sky



Hands are silent

Voice is numb

Try to scream out my lungs

Flashes left in my mind

Going back to the time

Playing games in the street

Kicking balls with my feet

Dancing on with my toes

Standing close to the edge

There's a pile of my clothes

At the end of your bed

As I feel myself fall

Make a joke of it all



You know I'll be

Is breathing for this

She closes the door

She's not afraid of scary movies

She likes the way we kiss in the dark

But she's so afraid of f-f-fallin' in love, oooh



Maybe she's just trying to test me

Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work

Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth (what you're worth)



Or maybe all her friends have told her

""Don't get closer—he'll just break your heart""

Had my chances, could've been where he is

Standing, that's what hurts the most

While I walk alone in the rain

If he took a look in my brain



Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?

Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo

And it's no joke to me

With a tight grip, then my kiss

Can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me



And I can lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

Again we take the same road two days in the same clothes

And I know just what she'll say if I make all this pain go

Can we stop this for a minute

You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it



Tell me with your mind, body, and spirit

I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British

Whether we're together or apart

We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start

And you'll never show weakness for letting go

But do you really want to be alone?

Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl

Everybody wanna take her heart away

Couple billion in the whole wide world

Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Kisses that queen, her walk is so mean

And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright

I don't exist if I don't have her

The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright

But I know, I know, I know for sure

Everybody wanna steal my girl

Everybody wanna take her heart away

Couple billion in the whole wide world

Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl

Everybody wanna take her heart away

Couple billion in the whole wide world

Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

She knows, she knows

That I never let her down before

She knows, she knows

That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me now

Everybody wants to steal my girl

Everybody wants to take her heart (love) away

Couple billion in the whole wide world

(Well) find another one 'cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl

Everybody wanna take her heart away

Couple billion in the whole wide world

But I, I gotta keep tryin'

Gotta keep my head held high



There's always gonna be another mountain

I'm always gonna wanna make it move

Always gonna be an uphill battle

Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

Ain't about how fast I get there

Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side

It's the climb



The struggles I'm facing

The chances I'm taking

Sometimes might knock me down, but

No I'm not breaking

I may not know it, but

These are the moments that

I'm gonna remember most, yeah

Just gotta keep goin',

And I, I gotta be strong

Just keep pushing on, 'cause

So hard that I couldn't take it

Want to wake up and see your face

And remember how good it was being here last night

Still high with a little feeling

I see the smile as it starts to creep in

It was there, I saw it in your eyes

I wanna feel your love

Time escapes me

Trembling hands

Touch skin

And the tears stream down my face



If we could only have this life

For one more day

If we could only turn back time

Close the door

Throw the key

Don't wanna be reminded

Don't wanna be seen

Don't wanna be without you

Hands are silent

Voice is numb

Try to scream out my lungs

Flashing lights in my mind

Going back to the time

Playing games in the street

Kicking balls with my feet



There's a numb in my toes

Standing close to the edge

There's a pile of my clothes

At the end of your bed



As I feel myself fall

Make a joke of it all



You know I'll be

Is breathing for this

I dont know what to do, what to do.

I'm loose but suddenly, becoming something true

and nothing can complain

I found in you and I could take way,

but I can't look back,

I shouldn't look back.



And I, I don't wanna wait,

another day with you,

I dont wanna take her heart

and give my heart at you.

Can you feel my heart beat?

Cause as look, as weight it feels,

but I'm tearing you apart,

read between the lines.

Oh, you're gonna read between the lines.



You take,take,and everything,

my heart can be the same,

as long as I regret to take away,

but something tells me dont look back

cause I will fall, and I will fall.

You say, our memories should look

at moving on.

And suddenly, the best to holding on

but something tells me that

I never should be afraid,

should be afraid.



And I, I don't wanna waste

another day with you,

I don't wanna take my heart

and feeling like at you

Can you feel my heart beat?

cause it's something, (about)

was not sure if she heard

The roof was pretty windy

and she didn't say a word

Party dying downstairs,

had nothing left to do

Just me,

her and the moon



I said you're on fire babe

then down came the lightning on me

Love can be frightening for sure



All I know at the end of the day

is you want what you want

and you say what you say

And you follow your heart

even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day

is you love who you love,

there ain't no other way

If there's something I've learned

from a million mistakes

You're the one that I want

at the end of the day



At the end of the day

You're the one that I want

at the end of the day



She said the night was over,

I said it's forever

20 minutes later,

wound up in the hospital

The priest thinks it's the devil,

my mum thinks it's the flu

But girl it's only you



I said you're on fire babe

then down came the lightning on me

Love can be frightening for sure



All I know at the end of the day

is you want what you want

and you say what you say

And you follow your heart

even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day

is you love who you love,

there ain't no other way

If there's something I've learned

from a million mistakes

You're the one that I want

When the sun goes down I know that you and me and everything will be alright

And when the city's sleeping

You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming

You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming



All I know at the end of the day

is you want what you want and you say what you say

And you follow your heart

even though it'll break sometimes

All I know at the end of the day

One by one, I gotta take them down

But you run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight

I hear them calling for you

I hear them calling

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out

Headed straight for your heart

They come straight for your heart

I hear them calling for you

I hear them calling for you



I keep on holding tight now

Cause your body's telling me don't let go

We're gonna be starting up trouble

I know, I know, I know

It's bringing my demons out

More than ever down

Your beauty could start a war

As you walk in the door



I ain't up for debating

Ain't enough for the taking

We got the world shaking



In the middle of the night when the wolves come out

Headed straight for your heart

Like a bullet in the dark

One by one, I gotta take them down

But you run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight

I hear them calling for you

I hear them calling

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out

Headed straight for your heart

They come straight for your heart

I hear them calling for you

I hear them calling for you



I wish it wasn't true

But the whole world's tryna get a piece of you

And my heart keeps fighting in this battle of fools

Gotta make it through, gotta make it through



In the middle of the night when the wolves come out

Headed straight for your heart

Like a bullet in the dark

One by one, I try to take them down

But you run and hide, ain't going down without a fight

I hear them calling for you

I hear them calling

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out

Headed straight for your heart

They come straight for your heart

I hear them calling for you

I hear them calling for you"

Kind of there but not quite

I'm walking round with just one shoe

I'm half a man at best

With half an arrow in my chest

I miss everything we do

I'm half a heart without you



Forget all we said that night

No, it doesn't even matter

'Cause we both got split in two



If you could spare an hour or so

We'll go for lunch down by the river

We can really talk it through

So I built you a house from a broken home

And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke

How to fix up a heart that I let down



Now I'm searching every lonely place

Every corner calling out your name

Tryna find you but I just don't know

Where do broken hearts go?



Get a taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue

It's at the top of the list of the things I want

Anyone in between is the enemy



Shadows come with the pain that you're running from

Love was something you've never heard enough

And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this

I'm just the underdog who finally got the girl

And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world



Truly, madly, deeply, I am

Foolishly, completely falling

And somehow you caved all my walls in

So baby, say you'll always keep me

Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you

In love with you



Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed

And wake you up with all the words that I still haven't said?

And tender touches, just to show you how I feel

Or should I act so cool like it was no big deal?



Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this

I'll put this day back on replay and keep reliving it

‘Cause here's the tragic truth if you don't feel the same

My heart would fall apart if someone said your name



And truly, madly, deeply, I am

Foolishly, completely falling

And somehow you caved all my walls in

So baby, say you'll always keep me

Hope you won't get up and leave

Might not mean that much to you

It just won't feel right



‘Cause I can love you more than this

‘Cause I can love you more than this, yeah



When he lays you down

I might just die inside

It just don't feel right

‘Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight

It just won't feel right

‘Cause I can love you more than this, yeah

but bear this mind it was meant to be

and I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks

and it all makes sense to me



I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile,

you've never loved your stomach or your thighs

the dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine

But I'll love them endlessly



I won't let this little things slip out of my mouth

But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to

I'm in love with you and all these little things



You can't go to bed without a cup of tea

maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep

and all those conversations are the secrets that i keep

though it makes no sense to me



I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape

you never want to know how much you weigh

you still have to squeeze into your jeans

but you're perfect to me



I won't let this little things slips out of my mouth

But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

I'm in love with you and all these little things



You never love yourself half as much as i love you

you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to

if I let you know, I'm here for you

maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh



I've just let these little things slips out of my mouth

because it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to

I'm in love with you, and all your little things.



I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

but if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to

I'm in love with you, and all your little things."

Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed

Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart

I tore it apart

And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence

And no woman in the world deserves this

But here I am asking you for one more chance



Can we fall, one more time?

Stop the tape and rewind

Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade

Cause there is nobody else



It's gotta be yoooooooooou

Only yoooooooooooooou

It's gotta be yoooooooooooooou

Only yoooooooooooooou



Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles

When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was

You've almost had enough

And your actions speak louder than words

And you're about to break from all you've heard

Don't be scared, I ain't going no where



I'll be here, by your side

No more fears, no more cryin'

But if you walk away

I know I'll fade

Cause there is nobody else



It's gotta be yooooooooooooou

Only yooooooooooooou

It's gotta be yooooooooooooou

Oh only yooooooooooooou



Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?

One more, one more, can we try?

One more, one more time

I'll make it better

One more, one more, can we try?

One more, one more,

Can we try one more time i'll make it all better?

gone by

Turn around

Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around, bright eyes

Every now and then I fall apart

Turn around, bright eyes

Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight

And I need you more than ever

And if you only hold me tight

We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right

'cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line

Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time

(All of the time)

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark

We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love, but now I'm only falling apart

There's nothing I can do

A total eclipse of the heart"

Changes into something red

Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

Everything she never had she's showing off



Driving too fast

Moon is breaking through her hair

She said it was something that she won't forget

Having no regrets is all that she really wants



We're only getting older baby

And I've been thinking about it lately

Does it ever drive you crazy

Just how fast the night changes?

Everything that you've ever dreamed of

Disappearing when you wake up

But there's nothing to be afraid of

Even when the night changes

It will never change me and you



Chasing it tonight,

Doubts are running ‘round her head

He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette

Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop



Moving too fast

Moon is lighting up her skin

She's falling, doesn't even know it yet

But you're no into them at all

You just want materials

I should know because I've heard

I want, I want, I want, and that's not me

I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

But you want accessories

Got to hold it in your hand

If I change the world for you

I bet you wouldn't have a clue

Don't you know that I can't stand

And if you like having secret little rendezvous

If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

Then baby, I'm perfect

Baby, I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

And if you like going places we can't even pronounce

If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about

Then baby, you're perfect

Baby, you're perfect

So let's start right now"

Had a band and we tried real hard

Jimmy quit, Jody got married

Shoulda known, we'd never get far



Oh when I look back now

That summer seemed to last forever

And if I had the choice

Yeah, I'd always want to be there

Those were the best days of my life



Oh yeah

Back in the summer of '69

Ohhh



Man we were killin' time

We were young and restless

We needed to unwind

I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

We're only getting older baby

And I've been thinking about it lately

Does it ever drive you crazy

Just how fast the night changes?

Everything that you've ever dreamed of

Disappearing when you wake up

But there's nothing to be afraid of

Even when the night changes



Even when the night changes



Even when the night changes

Doubts are running 'round her head

He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette

Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop



Drivin' too fast

Moon is lighting up her skin

She's falling, doesn't even know it yet

All my favourite conversations,

Always made in the AM, yeah



Feels like this could be forever tonight,

Break these clocks forget about time,

There could be world war three,

Going on outside,

You and me were raised in the same part of town,

Got these scars on the same ground

Remember how we used to kick around

Just wasting time?



Won't you stay till the AM?

All my favourite conversations

Always made in the AM, yeah

‘Cause we don't know what we're saying

We're just swimming around in our glasses

And talking out of our asses

Like we're all gonna make it, yeah yeah



Feels like this could be forever right now,

Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreaming out loud,

Trying to behave but you know we never learned how,



You and me were raised in the same part of town,

Got these scars on the same ground,

Remember how we used to kick around,

Just wasting time?

I'm swagging out in london, hella boy

I see this girl playing with her toys

She got a couple of beach balls she's blowing up

But that won't be the only thing she is blowing



I wanna dye my hair black, not blonde

Simon baby, why won't you let me

I don't wanna be a blonde bimbo

or look like I'm trapped in Taylor Swift's song

So if you opened up your eyes

Would you see that box surprise?

One, one chance to dance (hey hey hey)

One, one chance to dance



But if your V is sweet not bitter

Yeah number 5, I'm alive, oh ritz biscuits

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh



But if you want to feature Little Mix

and get some other chicks

To make this sound more of a hit

Let's do it, Get more money in Cowell's pocket, YEAH HEH HEH

Tongue-tied over three words, cursed.

Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt,

Body's intertwined with her lips



Now she's feeling so low since she went solo

Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo

And it's no joke to me

So can we do it all over again?



If you're pretending from the start like this,

With a tight grip, then my kiss

Can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me



And I can lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again



Can we take the same road two days in the same clothes?

And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go

Can we stop this for a minute?

You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it



Tell me with your mind, body and spirit

I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British

Whether we're together or apart

We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start



If you're pretending from the start like this,

With a tight grip, then my kiss

Can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me



And I can lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again



You'll never know how to make it on your own

And you'll never show weakness for letting go

I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown

But do you really wanna be alone?



If you're pretending from the start like this,

With a tight grip, then my kiss

Can mend your broken heart

I might miss everything you said to me



And I can lend you broken parts

That might fit like this

And I will give you all my heart

So we can start it all over again



If you're pretending from the start like this,

Can mend your broken heart

Closer, maybe looking closer, there's more to discover

Find out what went wrong without blaming each other

Think that we got more time, when we're falling behind



Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games

And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change



And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same

But we're making all the same mistakes

Wake up, we both need to wake up, maybe if we face up to this

We can make it through this

Closer, maybe we'll be closer, stronger than we were before, yeah



Make this something more, yeah

When it's broken, you say there's nothing to fix

And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay

While you're making all the same mistakes

Don't look back, but if we don't look back

We're only learning then

How to make all samemistakes again

Does all the things

While we dance in the moonlight

I wish it was me that you'll call later on

And I can see your head is held in shame

I just wanna see you smile again

But don't burn out

Even if you scream and shout

It'll come back to you

And I'll be here for you



Oh, I will carry you over fire and water for your love

And I will hold you closer, hope your heart is strong enough

When the night is coming down on you

We will find a way through the dark



I wish that I could take you to the start

I'd never let you fall and break your heart

And if you wanna cry and fall apart

I'll be there to hold ya



You tell me that you heard it's all in vain

But I can see your heart can love again

And I remember you were laughing

So let's just laugh again

She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones

It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone



And I'll be gone gone tonight

The ground beneath my feet is open wide

The way that I been holdin' on too tight

With nothing in between



The story of my life I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm and time

Is frozen (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life I give her hope

I spend her love until she's broke inside

The story of my life (the story of, the story of)



Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change

Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage



I know that in the morning now

I'll see us in the light upon a hill

Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still



And I'll be gone gone tonight

The fire beneath my feet is burning bright

The way that I been holdin' on so tight

With nothing in between



The story of my life I take her home

I drive all night to keep her warm and time

Is frozen (the story of, the story of)

And I been waiting for this time to come around

I'm all out of faith



This is how I feel

I'm cold and I am shamed

Lying naked on the floor



Illusion never changed

Into something real

I'm wide awake

And I can see

The perfect sky is torn

You don't know

You don't know you're beautiful

Baby you light up my world like nobody else

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell

You don't know

You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see

You'll understand why I want you so desperately

Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

You don't know

You don't know you're beautiful

Oh oh

But that's what makes you beautiful"

Keep 'em falling when I know it hurts

Going faster than a million miles an hour

Trying to catch my breath some way, somehow

Down to Earth

It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns

Stuck in motion, but the wheels keep spinning 'round

Moving in reverse with no way out



And now I'm one step closer to being

Two steps far from you

And everybody wants you



Everybody wants you



How many nights does it take to count the stars?

That's the time it would take to fix my heart

Oh, baby, I was there for you

All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?

Lay awake only hoping they're okay

I never counted all of mine.

If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity.

Infinity, infinity, yeah.

Infinity."

Believe me, I will use them both

We made a start

Be it a false one, I know

Baby, I don't want to feel alone



So kiss me where I lay down

My hands pressed to your cheeks

A long way from the playground



I have loved you since we were 18

Long before we both thought the same thing

To be loved and to be in love

All I can do is say that these arms are made for holding you, oh

I wanna love like you made me feel

When we were 18



We took a chance

God knows we tried

Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

So pour me a drink, oh love

And let's split the night wide open, and we'll see everything

Living love in slow motion, motion, motion



So kiss me where I lay down

My hands pressed to your cheeks

A long way from the playground



I have loved you since we were 18

Long before we both thought the same thing

To be loved and to be in love

Three words that I left to late

And your actions speak louder than words 

And you're about to break from all you've heard
